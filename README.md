# CG-SegmentAlgorithm

This is our GitHub repository we used for our Capstone Project. In this repository you will find all of the code that we used to create our algorithm, as well as all of the data we used for our applications. 

# Repo Contents
## Datasets
- `citysegments_meters.csv` - interstate segments from only the Twin Cities ~ 1000 segments
- `highways_segments_mn.csv` - interstate segments from MN, reduced to ~2000 segments
- `highwaysegments_fullstate.csv` - interstate segments from the entire state of MN ~ 5000 segments
- `mn_cities_50k_plus.csv` - first large dataset containing 50k+ highway segments from MN
- `statesegments_meters.csv` - second test dataset containning only 20k segments from MN
- `galaxies.csv` - Segmentation list of 1053 galaxies filaments
- `test.csv` - 4 non-disjoint line segments in random orientation; no chains
- `line.csv` - a simple chain of 4 line segments
- `square.csv` - 4 line segments with adjacent orthogonality

## Jupyter Notebooks
- `vd-ipynb` - Primary code file; run each cell to see our results
